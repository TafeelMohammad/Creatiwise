      question: "What is your design process?",
      answer:
        "My design process typically involves four key phases: research, design, prototype, and test. In the research phase, I gather insights about the user and their needs. In the design phase, I create wireframes and visual designs that meet those needs. In the prototype phase, I create interactive models of the design for testing. In the test phase, I collect feedback from users to refine the design."
    },
    {
      question: "What tools and software do you use for UX design?",
      answer: "I use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, InVision, and user testing tools like Maze or Hotjar depending on the project needs."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure the success of your UX designs?",
      answer: "I measure success through usability testing, user satisfaction, goal conversions, and metrics like bounce rate, task completion rate, and Net Promoter Score (NPS)."
